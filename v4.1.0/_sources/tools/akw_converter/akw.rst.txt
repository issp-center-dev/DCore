A(k,w) converter
=========================================

DCore can generate four-dimensional data of :math:`A(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)` on a linear grid.
An auxiliary tool ``akw_converter`` converts these data into three-dimensional volumeric data with a fixed value of :math:`\omega` that is suitable for reading with existing 3D graphic softwares such as VESTA.

How to use
----------

The following steps should be done after all calculations are finished, namely, self-consistent calculation by ``dcore`` and even post calculations by ``dcore_spectrum``.

#. **Modifying ini file**

   To change the output directory from the default value (``post``), ``dir_post`` is added to the ini file as

   ::

     [post]
     dir_post = post_grd

   Then, to activate the grid calculation, the following block is added to the ini file

   ::

     [post.spectrum]
     nk_mesh = 100

   This parameter activates a grid calculation.
   :math:`A(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)` is to be computed on a four-dimensional grid of size :math:`100^3 \times N_{\omega}`.
   In order to reduce the data size, one could instead specify a set of 3 parameters as

   ::

     [post.spectrum]
     nk0_mesh = 100
     nk1_mesh = 100
     nk2_mesh = 4

   In this case, :math:`k_z` is computed on 0, pi/2, pi and 3pi/3.
   Note that the k-grid is generated in the *primitive* reciprocal space.
   It is also highly recommended to reduce the number of frequency points. For example, if only the Fermi surface is of interest, one can set

   ::

     [post.anacont]
     Nomega = 3
     omega_max = 1.0
     omega_min = -1.0

   Then, :math:`\omega=0` and two additional points are selected (``Nomega = 1`` is not allowed).
   In this way, the data points are reduced to :math:`100^2 \times 4 \times 3`.

#. **Executing dcore\_anacont and dcore\_spectrum**

   Now, ``dcore_anacont`` and ``dcore_spectrum`` are (re-)executed by

   ::

     dcore_anacont square.ini
     dcore_spectrum --np 4 square.ini

   The number of processes in the ``--np`` option  (4 above) should be changed according to your environment.
   In this case, the data are saved in 'post_grd' directory.
   We recommend to use this option to have k-path data and k-grid data in separate directories.

   The four-dimensional grid data are save in a file '*seed*\_akw\_mesh\_*sp*.dat', where *seed* is the seed name given in the ini file, and *sp* is the spin index ('up' and 'down' if spin-orbit coupling is not considered and 'ud' otherwise).

#. **Executing akw\_converter.py**

   Finally, ``akw_converter`` is executed.
   ``akw_converter.py`` is installed in bin directory, where other executables such as ``dcore`` and ``dcore_post`` are installed.

   ::

     akw_converter.py --omega 0.0 post_grd/square_akw_mesh_up.dat post_grd/akw_up.grd

   The value of :math:`\omega` is given by the ``--omega`` option. If data do not exist just on this :math:`\omega`, :math:`A(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)` is interpolated using 2 points nearby (depending on the kind of interpolation method).
   The first argument is the path to the four-dimensional data generated by ``dcore_spectrum``. The second argument is the output file name. The default format is **GRD**, and the output filename should have extension 'grd'.

   The full option of ``akw_converter`` can be seen by the command
   ::

     akw_converter.py -h


Example
---------

As an example, we solve
:doc:`the square-lattice model in tutorial <../../tutorial/square/square>`.
The ini file is changed as below.

:download:`dmft_square_akw.ini <dmft_square_akw.ini>`

We use the CT-HYB solver to obtain a better spectrum.
The occupation number is changed from n=1 to n=0.8 to break the particle-hole symmetry.

A GRD file generated by the converter is opened by VESTA.
A two-dimensional plot is made by "Utilities --> 2D Data Display".
The plot clearly shows the Fermi surface in the square-lattice mode:

.. image:: vesta_2d_data_display.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center

We note that one needs to change some configuration to have the above plot.
One goes to "Slice" and change (1) "Distance from origin" from 0.5 to 0 to select :math:`k_z=0` plane, and (2) "Ranges of fractional coordinates" from [0:1] to [-0.5:0.5] to shift the Gamma point to the center of the plot.
The figure below shows the Slice panel:
