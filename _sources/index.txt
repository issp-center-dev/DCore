DCore
======

DCore is aimed at model calculations and ab-initio calculations by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).
This package consists of programs with text-based and hdf5-based interface.
These programs enable users to perform DMFT calculations and analyze results without writing computer code.
The current version is built on TRIQS Python libraries.
We will add supports for impurity solvers based on ALPSCore libraries in future.

Learn how to use this package in the :ref:`documentation`.
