Tutorial with QuantumESPRESSO and wannier90
===========================================

Quantum ESPRESSO is a first-principles program package based on
the plane wave and pseudopotentials.

wannier90 is a library and post-processing tool for generating wannier orbitals
from results by many DFT programs.

In this tutorial we will perform DFT+DMFT calculations of SrVO\ :sub:`3` and NiS.
