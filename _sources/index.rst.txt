DCore
=====

integrated **D**\ MFT software for **Cor**\ related **e**\ lectrons

What is DCore?
--------------

`DCore <https://github.com/issp-center-dev/DCore>`_ is aimed at model calculations and ab-initio calculations by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).
This package consists of programs with text-based and hdf5-based interface.
These programs enable users to perform DMFT calculations and analyze results without writing computer code.
