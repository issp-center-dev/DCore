DCore is a DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) driver which works together with other
first-principles program packages.
DCore supports input hopping parameters as the wannier90 format.
It can also perform calculation of simple preset models (such as the Bethe lattice);
it can be used for the practice of this code.
After we finish DMFT loop, we can compute the density of states and
the spectrum function with the post-processing tool.

The interface layer
-------------------

The pre-processing tool, ``dcore_pre`` can generate models from the wannier orbitals
as well as intrinsic model-generator (Standard interface).

Standard interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Bethe lattice
* Chain lattice
* Square lattice
* Cubic lattice
  
For more details, please see :ref:`inputformat`.

Wannier90 interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DCore can read files generated by wannier90 code (or same format).

Post-processing
---------------

Currently, DCore can compute following quantities.

* (projected) density of states
* correlated band structures (*spaghettis*)
