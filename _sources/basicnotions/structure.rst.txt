  **DCore** is a set of DMFT (Dynamical Mean Field Theory) programs which works together with other first-principles calculation packages.
  **DCore** supports input hopping parameters in the wannier90 format.
  Simple preset models such as a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice are also available.
  After the DMFT loop is finished, one can compute physical quantities such as the density of states and the momentum-resolved spectrum functions using the post-processing tool.

**DCore** consists of three layers: interface layer, DMFT loop, and post-processing. Those respectively performed by the executables ``dcore_pre``, ``dcore``, ``dcore_post``.
Input parameters are provided by a single text file, which is read by all the three programs.
Data generated by ``dcore_pre`` and ``dcore`` are severally stored in a file with HDF5 format and passed to the next process.


The interface layer ``dcore_pre``
---------------------------------

..
  The pre-processing tool, ``dcore_pre`` can generate models from the wannier orbitals
  as well as intrinsic model-generator (Standard interface).

There are two types of interfaces: **standard interface** for models and **Wannier90 interface** for materials.
The pre-processing tool, ``dcore_pre``, generates a HDF5 file necessary for the DMFT loop.

Standard interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preset models include

* Bethe lattice
* Chain lattice
* Square lattice
* Cubic lattice

..
  For more details, please see :ref:`inputformat`.

Wannier90 interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..
  **DCore** can read files generated by wannier90 code (or same format).

Results of ab-initio calculations can be imported into **DCore**.
``dcore_pre`` reads the hopping parameters in the Wannier90 format and transform to HDF5.

DMFT loop ``dcore``
-------------------

``dcore`` is the main program for the DMFT calculations.
The effective impurity problem is solved repeatedly to fulfill the self-consistency condition of the DMFT.
For solving the impurity problem, ``dcore`` calls an external program such as continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method and Hubbard-I approximation.

Post-processing ``dcore_post``
------------------------------
..
  Currently, **DCore** can compute following quantities:

``dcore_post`` computes some physical quantities from the converged solution of the DMFT loop.
Currently, the following quantities can be calculated:

* (projected) density of states
* Correlated band structures (momentum-resolved single-particle excitation spectrum)
