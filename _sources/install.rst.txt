Installation
============

Download
--------

You can download the source files in two ways.

- **[Release version]**

  Go to the `release page <https://github.com/issp-center-dev/DCore/releases>`_ and download the latest tar or zip file.
  You can unpack, for example, the tar file by

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ tar zxvf v2.x.x.tar.gz

- **[Develop version]**

  Newly implemented features are available in the source code in GitHub repository. You can clone the repository by

  .. code-block:: bash

      $ git clone https://github.com/issp-center-dev/DCore.git dcore.src

  The master branch basically corresponds to the latest released package, and the develop branch includes new features.
  Note that develop branches may not be well tested and contains some bugs.

Prerequisites
-------------

#. You first need to install `TRIQS <https://triqs.github.io/triqs/>`_ library prior to installing all other programs,
   since ``DCore`` is implemented using ``TRIQS``.

   In the following, we suppose that ``TRIQS`` is installed in directory *path_to_triqs*.

   .. note::

     ``DCore`` supports ``TRIQS`` version **1.4.2** (the current version 2.0 is not supported).
     Since the installation manual in the TRIQS official website is not compatible with **1.4.2**, we briefly describe below how to install it.

     #. You can download the zip file or tar file from https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/releases/tag/1.4.2.
        The version **1.4.2** is not compatible with the latest version of h5py (>=2.8.0).
        If you encounter any problem, you can clone the repository and checkout **1.4.x** branch, which contains bug fixes.
        We suppose that source files are located in *path_to_triqs_src* directory.

     #. In an empty directory, type the following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

          $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_triqs path_to_triqs_src
          $ make
          $ make test
          $ make install

#. You also need `DFTTools <https://triqs.github.io/dft_tools>`_, which runs on the ``TRIQS`` library.

   .. note::

     The current version in the GitHub repository is not compatible with ``TRIQS`` version 1.4.2.
     You need to get old code that is compatible with 1.4.2.

     #. Clone the repository, and checkout commit **d005756**.

        .. code-block:: bash

          $ git clone git@github.com:TRIQS/dft_tools.git
          $ cd dft_tools
          $ git checkout d005756

     #. To build the source files, make an empty directory, move into it, and then type the following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

          $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_triqs\
            -DTRIQS_PATH=path_to_triqs path_to_dft_tools
          $ make
          $ make test
          $ make install

#. You will also need at least one impurity solver.

   For example, the following programs are supported at present:

   * :doc:`ALPS/CT-HYB<impuritysolvers/alpscore_cthyb/cthyb>`
   * :doc:`ALPS/CT-HYB-SEGMENT<impuritysolvers/alpscore_ctseg/ctseg>`
   * :doc:`TRIQS/cthyb<impuritysolvers/triqs_cthyb/cthyb>`
   * :doc:`Hubbard-I solver<impuritysolvers/triqs_hubbard_one/hubbard_one>`

   See :doc:`impuritysolvers` for a complete list of supported impurity solvers and their user manuals.

..
   * `Hubbard-I solver <https://triqs.ipht.cnrs.fr/1.x/applications/hubbardI/>`_
   * `ALPS/CT-HYB <https://github.com/ALPSCore/CT-HYB>`_
   * `ALPS/CT-HYB-SEGMENT <https://github.com/ALPSCore/CT-HYB-SEGMENT>`_
   * `TRIQS/cthyb <https://triqs.ipht.cnrs.fr/applications/cthyb/index.html>`_

..
   .. note::

      One must build TRIQS, TRIQS/DFTTools, and TRIQS solvers using the same C++ compiler with the same C++ standard (C++14).
      One does not necessarily have to build ALPS/CT-HYB and/or ALPS/CT-HYB-SEGMENT with the same C++ compiler as that used for TRIQS.

Installation steps
------------------

#. Create an empty directory where you will compile the code

   ::

     $ mkdir dcore.build && cd dcore.build

#. In the build directory, call cmake command with an option to specify the path to TRIQS library

   ::

     $ cmake -DTRIQS_PATH=path_to_triqs path_to_dcore_src -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path_to_dcore_install_directory

   Here, *path_to_triqs* refers to your ``TRIQS`` install directory, and *path_to_dcore_src* refers to the ``DCore`` source directory.
   Please set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to the directory where DCore will be installed.
   If the cmake command succeeded, you will see the following message.

   ::

     -- Build files have been written to: /.../dcore.build

#. Build DCore by

   ::

     $ make

#. We recommend that you run the tests to check if the compiling is properly finished. Type

   ::

     $ make test

   The test results look like

#. Finally, install by

   ::

     $ make install

   ``DCore`` is installed in the directory *path_to_dcore_install_directory*.

.. Version compatibility
.. ---------------------
..
.. The current version of DCore supports TRIQS 1.4, and ALPSCore 2.1 or later.
.. Be careful that the version of the TRIQS library and of the dft tools must be
.. compatible (more information on the :ref:`TRIQS website <triqslibs:welcome>`).
.. If you want to use a version of the dft tools that is not the latest one, go
.. into the directory with the sources and look at all available versions::
..
..      $ cd src && git tag
..
.. Checkout the version of the code that you want, for instance::
..
..      $ git co 1.4
..
.. Then follow the steps 2 to 5 described above to compile the code.
