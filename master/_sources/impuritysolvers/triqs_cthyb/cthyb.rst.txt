=======================

.. include:: ../../warning_compatibility.rst

Install
-------

Follow the installation guide in `TRIQS/cthyb <https://triqs.github.io/cthyb/1.4/>`_.

.. note::

    - Checkout tag **1.4.2** on master branch, or download the released package
      from `here <https://github.com/TRIQS/cthyb/releases/tag/1.4.2>`_.

    - Be sure to use the same C++ compiler as the one used to build the ``TRIQS`` library.

    - If you want to treat the spin-orbit coupling in ``TRIQS/cthyb`` solver,
      it must be built with the following CMake options:

      ::

        -DHYBRIDISATION_IS_COMPLEX=ON -DLOCAL_HAMILTONIAN_IS_COMPLEX=ON

Basic parameters for QMC
------------------------

The accuracy of the TRIQS/cthyb calculation depends on mainly the following
three parameters.

 * ``n_cycles{int}``

   The number of QMC cycles for computing any quantities.
   The numerical noise can be reduced by increasing this parameter.
 
   When we use the MPI parallelism, the total number of QMC cycle
   ( ``number-of-processes * n_cycles``) affects the accuracy.
   Therefore,
   **n_cycles in inverse proportion to the number of MPI processes keeps the accuracy**.
 
 * ``n_warmup_cycles{int}``

   The number of QMC cycles for the thermalization before the above main calculation.
   If it is insufficient, the state to be computed may be different from the
   equilibrium state.

   **This parameter is independent of the MPI parallelism.**
 
 * ``length_cycle{int}``

   Each QMC cycles have sub-cycles.
   The length of this sub-cycle should be long enough to escape from the auto-correlation.

   **This parameter is independent of the MPI parallelism.**

The computational time is proportional to ``length_cycle*(n_cycles+n_warmup_cycles)``.
The following script is an example to describe the procedure for searching appropriate QMC parameter. 

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash

   cat > pre.ini <<EOF
   [model]
   seedname = bethe
   lattice = bethe
   norb = 1
   nelec = 1.0
   t = 1.0
   kanamori = [(4.0, 0.0, 0.0)]

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100

   [impurity_solver]
   name = TRIQS/cthyb
   n_warmup_cycles{int} = 10000
   n_cycles{int} = 10000
   length_cycle{int} = 100

   [control]
   max_step = 1
   EOF

   dcore_pre pre.ini

   n_cycles[0]=3000;   n_warmup_cycles[0]=5000; length_cycle[0]=50
   n_cycles[1]=10000;  n_warmup_cycles[1]=5000; length_cycle[1]=50
   n_cycles[2]=30000;  n_warmup_cycles[2]=5000; length_cycle[2]=50
   n_cycles[3]=100000; n_warmup_cycles[3]=5000; length_cycle[3]=50
   n_cycles[4]=300000; n_warmup_cycles[4]=5000; length_cycle[4]=50
   n_cycles[5]=300000; n_warmup_cycles[5]=5000; length_cycle[5]=100

   for i in `seq 0 5`
   do
       sed -e "/n_cycles/c n_cycles{int} = ${n_cycles[i]}" \
           -e "/n_wamup_cycles/c n_warmup_cycles{int} = ${n_wamup_cycles[i]}" \
           -e "/length_cycle/c length_cycle{int} = ${length_cycle[i]}" \
       pre.ini > dmft.ini
       mpiexec -np 4 dcore dmft.ini
       dcore_check dmft.ini --output bethe.pdf
       mv bethe_sigma.dat cyc${n_cycles[i]}_warm${n_warmup_cycles[i]}_len${length_cycle[i]}.dat
   done

Then, we use gnuplot as

.. code-block:: gnuplot

   plot [0:10][-0.6:0] \
   "cyc3000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3, \
   "cyc10000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3, \
   "cyc30000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3, \
   "cyc100000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3, \
   "cyc300000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3, \
   "cyc300000_warm5000_len100.dat" u 1:3 w l lw 3

and obtain

.. image:: QMCparam.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center

From this plot, we can see that both parameter settings are insufficient and
we have to increase ``n_cycles`` or ``length_cycle`` or both of them
(In almost cases, ``n_warmup_cycles`` has minor effect).

   
High-frequency tail fit
-----------------------

The self energy computed with QMC becomes noisy at the high frequency region.
This high-frequency tail can be fitted by using the following function:

.. math::

   \Sigma_{\rm tail}(i \omega) \approx \frac{a_1}{\omega} + \frac{a_2}{\omega^2} +
   \frac{a_3}{\omega^3} + \cdots

We show the procedure for using this technique.
The original input file (without tail-fit) is as follows (dmft.ini):

.. code-block:: ini

   [model]
   seedname = bethe
   lattice = bethe
   norb = 1
   nelec = 1.0
   t = 1.0
   kanamori = [(4.0, 0.0, 0.0)]

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100

   [impurity_solver]
   name = TRIQS/cthyb
   n_warmup_cycles{int} = 10000
   n_cycles{int} = 100000
   length_cycle{int} = 50
   
   [control]
   max_step = 1
   
   [tool]
   omega_check = 30.0

We first execute the ordinary DMFT calculation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dcore_pre dmft.ini
   $ mpiexec -np 4 dcore dmft.ini
   $ dcore_check dmft.ini --output bethe.pdf

Then, looking at the figure in bethe.pdf,
we choose the energy range where the tail-fit is performed.

.. _tailfit:

.. image:: tailfit.png
   :align: center

In this case, we choose energy range from 6 to 15 [red box in (a) in the above figure], and
add the following parameters at the ``[system]`` block in the input file
(not the
`solver parameter <https://triqs.ipht.cnrs.fr/applications/cthyb/reference/solve_parameters.html>`_
for the tail fit):

.. code-block:: ini

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100
   perform_tail_fit = True
   fit_max_moment = 2
   fit_min_w = 6.0
   fit_max_w = 15.0

We run ``dcore_check`` again, and obtain the result as (b) in the above figure.
If necessary, we repeat editing the input file and running ``dcore_check`` to refine the energy range.
After the energy range is fixed, we again perform the QMC calculation by ``dcore``. The final result looks like (c) in the
above figure.

Multi-band system
-----------------

For the multi-band systems, **we have to include the two-pairs insertion/removal move**
in the QMC cycles as

.. code-block:: ini

   [impurity_solver]
   name = TRIQS/cthyb
   move_double{bool} = True

because these moves are disabled in the default setting.

Pade approximation for DOS and spectrum function
------------------------------------------------

To obtain spectral functions, we need to perform analytical continuation from Matsubara frequency to real frequency.
Currently, the Pade approximation is the only choice for the analytical continuation.

There is one control parameter for Pade approximation, ``omega_pade`` in the ``[tool]`` block. It specifies an energy cutoff for Matsubara frequency.
A reasonable choice of ``omega_pade`` is the maximum frequency
before the self energy becomes noisy.
For example, in the case of figure (a) above, we can find that ``omega_pade=4.0`` is reasonable.

Legendre filter
---------------

.. warning::

   Do not use it together with the tail-fit.

This is another technique to reduce the high-frequency noise.
In this method, we expand the Green's function at the imaginary time with a series of
the Legendre polynomials, and ignore the higher order polynomials.

This scheme is activated when we specify the input parameter ``n_l``
(the number of polynomial included) in the ``[system]`` block as

.. code-block:: ini

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100
   n_l = 30

When we use the Legendre filter, we should check that how many polynomials
have to be included.
For this purpose, we first perform a calculation with a large number of Legendre
polynomials (e.g. ``n_l=80``) and check how the coefficient decays.

For examples, we run the bash script as

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash

   cat > pre.ini <<EOF
   [model]
   seedname = bethe
   lattice = bethe
   norb = 1
   nelec = 1.0
   t = 1.0
   kanamori = [(4.0, 0.0, 0.0)]

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100
   n_l = 30

   [impurity_solver]
   name = TRIQS/cthyb
   n_warmup_cycles{int} = 10000
   n_cycles{int} = 10000
   length_cycle{int} = 100

   [control]
   max_step = 1
   EOF

   dcore_pre pre.ini

   n_cycles[0]=3000;   n_warmup_cycles[0]=5000; length_cycle[0]=50
   n_cycles[1]=10000;  n_warmup_cycles[1]=5000; length_cycle[1]=50
   n_cycles[2]=30000;  n_warmup_cycles[2]=5000; length_cycle[2]=50
   n_cycles[3]=100000; n_warmup_cycles[3]=5000; length_cycle[3]=50
   n_cycles[4]=300000; n_warmup_cycles[4]=5000; length_cycle[4]=50
   n_cycles[5]=300000; n_warmup_cycles[5]=5000; length_cycle[5]=100

   for i in `seq 0 5`
   do
       sed -e "/n_cycles/c n_cycles{int} = ${n_cycles[i]}" \
           -e "/n_wamup_cycles/c n_warmup_cycles{int} = ${n_wamup_cycles[i]}" \
           -e "/length_cycle/c length_cycle{int} = ${length_cycle[i]}" \
       pre.ini > dmft.ini
       mpiexec -np 4 dcore dmft.ini
       dcore_check dmft.ini --output bethe.pdf
       mv bethe_legendre.dat l_cyc${n_cycles[i]}_warm${n_warmup_cycles[i]}_len${length_cycle[i]}.dat
   done

Then, we use GnuPlot as

.. .. code-block:: gnuplot
.. code-block:: guess

   set xlabel "Order of polynomial"
   set ylabel "Coefficient"
   set logscale y
   plot \
   "l_cyc3000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3, \
   "l_cyc10000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3, \
   "l_cyc30000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3, \
   "l_cyc100000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3, \
   "l_cyc300000_warm5000_len50.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3, \
   "l_cyc300000_warm5000_len100.dat" u 1:(abs($2)) w l lw 3

and obtain

.. image:: legendre.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center

Finally, we choose the following setting:

.. code-block:: ini

   [model]
   seedname = bethe
   lattice = bethe
   norb = 1
   nelec = 1.0
   t = 1.0
   kanamori = [(4.0, 0.0, 0.0)]

   [system]
   beta = 40.0
   nk = 100
   n_l = 30

   [impurity_solver]
   name = TRIQS/cthyb
   n_warmup_cycles{int} = 5000
   n_cycles{int} = 300000
   length_cycle{int} = 100

   [control]
   max_step = 1

   [tool]
   omega_check = 30.0

and obtain
