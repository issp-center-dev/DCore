Multiorbital model by a QMC solver
==================================

:download:`dmft_bethe.ini <dmft_bethe.ini>`

An interesting phenomena called spin-freezing transition occurs in multi-orbital models
[`P. Werner, E. Gull, M. Troyer and A. J. Millis, PRL 101, 166405 (2008) <https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.166405>`_].
The spin-freezing phenomena is signaled by a peculiar frequency dependence of the self-energy: :math:`\mathrm{Im}\Sigma(i\omega_n) \propto \omega_n^{0.5}`.
In this tutorial, we solve the three-orbital model on a Bethe lattice to reproduce the results in the above reference.

.. literalinclude:: dmft_bethe.ini
   :language: ini
                              
Pre-process : ``dcore_pre``
---------------------------

.. First, we have to generate the lattice model as
.. The h5 file stores information of the model including the lattice structure, hopping parameters, interaction parameters.

We first generate a h5 file that is necessary for DMFT calculations.
The script ``dcore_pre`` is invoked for this purpose:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dcore_pre dmft_bethe.ini

.. Then it outputs model HDF5 file (``bethe.h5``).
.. Parameters in [model] and [system] blocks are reads in the input file.

If successful, a h5 file named *seedname*.h5 (``bethe.h5`` in the present case) is generated.

DMFT loop : ``dcore``
---------------------

The DMFT loop is performed by ``dcore`` program.
In this tutorial, we use continuous-time QMC implementation of ALPS/CT-HYB.
The runtime of the impurity solver is set to 300 sec.
You should not use the Hubbard-I solver for a metallic system.
One can run the program with 24 MPI processes as follows.
For solving the same model with TRIQS/cthyb, use 
:download:`this input file <triqs_cthyb/dmft_bethe.ini>` instead.


.. code-block:: bash

   $ export MPIRUN="mpirun"
   $ dcore dmft_bethe.ini --np 24

.. Then it generates the result HDF5 file.

Any environment variables in ``command`` of the mpi section and ``exec_path`` of the impurity_solver section are expanded at runtime.
In addition, ``#`` in ``command`` of the mpi section is replaced by the number of processes specified at runtime (24 in this case).
In the above example, we defined the environment varible ``MPIRUN``.

Note that ``dcore`` must be lauched without using the mpirun command as
it launches MPI processes internally for heavy tasks.
The QMC solver is executed with the number of MPI processes as well.

Each self-consistent step takes around 5 min,
most of which is spent for solving an effective impurity problem by QMC.
40 iterations take around 200 min.
Results for the self-energy and Green's function in each iteration are accumulated into a h5 file named *seedname*.out.h5 (``bethe.out.h5`` in the present case).

One can check the convergence of DMFT iterations by using ``dcore_check`` program as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dcore_check dmft_bethe.ini

.. We can find the following standard output.

``dcore_check`` program prints the value of the chemical potential at each iteration on the standard output:

    Done

.. We also can see the imaginary-time self-energy at last seven iterations.

``dcore_check`` generates several figures as well as data files in text format.
For instance, ``check/iter_sigma-ish0.png`` shows how the renormalization factor converges for each orbital.

If those results are not converged, one can restart DMFT iterations.

You can plot the data for positive Matsubara frequencies as follows (like Fig. 3 of PRL 101, 166405 (2008)) using
:download:`a gnuplot command file <plot.plt>`.


The reference data extracted from PRL 101, 166405 (2008) are available 
:download:`here <sigma-PRL101-166405.txt>`.
The plot should look like the following.
