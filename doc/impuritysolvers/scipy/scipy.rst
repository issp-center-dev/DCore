Exact diagonalization solver: ``scipy/sparse``
==============================================

``scipy/sparse`` computes the Green's function by the exact diagonalization (ED) method. Small matrices are diagonalized by full diagonalization method implemented in ``scipy.linalg``, while large mtrices are treated by sparse solvers implemented in ``scipy.sparse.linalg``.

Features
--------

- Arbitrary temperature

- All interactions available in ``DCore`` are supported.

- Support thread parallelization by OpenMP (via NumPy and SciPy).

Install
-------

The following Python library needs to be installed:

- SciPy

Input parameters
----------------

Parameters for this solver are as follows:

::

    [impurity_solver]
    name = scipy/sparse
    n_bath{int} = 0
    # fit_gtol{float} = 1e-5
    # dim_full_diag{int} = 10000
    # particle_numbers{str} = [1,2,3]
    # weight_threshold{float} = 1e-6
    # n_eigen{int} = 100
    # eigen_solver{str} = eigsh
    # gf_solver{str} = bicgstab
    # check_n_eigen{bool} = False
    # check_orthonormality{bool} = False

The first two parameters are mandatory. The remaining parameters, which are commented out, are optional.

The table below shows the detailed description of the parameters.

    :header: "Name", "Type", "Default", "Description"

    "n_bath", "int", "0", "Number of bath sites. See :doc:`Pomerol solver<../pomerol/pomerol>` for details."
    "fit_gtol", "float", "1e-5", "Tolerance for the fitting of the hybridization function. See :doc:`Pomerol solver<../pomerol/pomerol>` for details."
    "dim_full_diag", "int", "10000", "Maximum dimension of the matrix to be diagonalized by full diagonalization method. If the matrix is larger than this value, it will be treated by sparse solver."
    "particle_numbers", "str", "auto", "Particle numbers to be considered. Allowed inputs are 'auto', 'all', or '[1,2,3]' etc. By default ('auto'), a minimal set of particle numbers is evaluated by prescreening calculations. If the set is known in advance, one can specify it in a list format, e.g., [1,2,3]. All particle numbers are considered if 'all' is chosen. Note that all states necessary to the Green's function calculation, namely, thermally occupied N-particle states and NÂ±1 states, should be included."
    "weight_threshold", "float", "1e-6", "Threshold for the Boltzmann factor. States with Boltzmann factor smaller than this value are ignored in the Green's function calculation."
    "n_eigen", "int", "100", "Number of eigenvalues to be computed in each :math:`N`-particle subspace by the sparse solver."
    "eigen_solver", "str", "eigsh", "Name of the eigenvalue solver to be used. Available option is `'eigsh' <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh.html#scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh>`_ only."
    "gf_solver", "str", "bicgstab", "Name of the linear equation solver to be used for Green's function calculation. Available options are 'spsolve', 'bicg', 'bicgstab', 'cg', 'cgs', 'gmres', 'lgmres', 'minres', 'qmr', 'gcrotmk', 'tfqmr'. See `SciPy official document <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.linalg.html#solving-linear-problems>`_ for details."
    "check_n_eigen", "bool", "True", "If True (default), calculation stops if ``n_eigen`` is not sufficient. Note that, even if this check is passed, ``n_eigen`` may be insufficient. One should check the convergence of the Green's function by increasing ``n_eigen``."
    "check_orthonormality", "bool", "True", "If True (default), orthonormality of the eigenvectors is checked. If the check fails, calculation stops."

Standard output
----------------

The standard output of the solver is saved in a file `stdout.log` in directory `work/imp_shell0_ite1`, where `shell0` and `ite1` stands for the `0`-th shell and the `1`-st iteration.

Some relevant output are explained below.

    Particle-number conservation:

      6 210
      7 120
      8 45
      9 10
     10 1

    Particle numbers to be considered:
     [0 1 2]

This shows the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix for each particle number. When ``particle_numbers`` option is given, the particle numbers to be considered are shown.

    Solving the eigenvalue problem...

    N = 0  (dim[N] = 1)
     full diagonalization
     Time: 0m0.000s

    N = 1  (dim[N] = 10)
     full diagonalization
     Time: 0m0.000s

    N = 2  (dim[N] = 45)
     full diagonalization
     Time: 0m0.001s

    N = 3  (dim[N] = 120)
     Iterative solver: n_eigen=100 eigenvalues are computed.
     Time: 0m0.009s

This shows the time taken for solving the eigenvalue problem for each particle number. The solver uses full diagonalization method for matrices smaller than ``dim_full_diag`` (set to 100 in this example), while it switches to sparse solver specified by ``eigen_solver`` for larger matrices.

    Calculating impurity Green's function...

    Initial state 1/32  (N = 5)

     particle excitation: N + 1 = 6
      Use the Lehmann representation

     hole excitation: N - 1 = 4
      Use the Lehmann representation

    Initial state 2/32  (N = 5)

     particle excitation: N + 1 = 6
      Use the Lehmann representation

     hole excitation: N - 1 = 4
      Use the Lehmann representation

This shows the calculation of the impurity Green's function. Lehmann representation is used when the dimension of :math:`N \pm 1`-particle states is smaller than ``dim_full_diag``. Otherwise, linear equations are solved by the sparse solver specified by ``gf_solver``. The output in this case is as follows:
