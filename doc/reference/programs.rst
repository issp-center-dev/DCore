Programs
========

**DCore** consists of four main programs, ``dcore_pre``, ``dcore``, ``dcore_check``  and ``dcore_post``.
All programs read a single input file (say *input.ini*) which contains parameters classified into blocks.
See :doc:`input`, for details on the relation between the parameter blocks and each program.

..
    All programs can read input files of the same type and get the information by using blocks.
    For details of input parameters defined in each block, see the next section.

In the following, brief explanations are given for each program.

Pre-processing : ``dcore_pre``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program generates model HDF5 file (*seedname*.h5).
You need to execute this program before running the main program, ``dcore``.

..
    by reading parameters defined in ``[model]`` and ``[system]`` blocks.

::

   $ dcore_pre input.ini

Main program : ``dcore``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the main program, which performs DMFT cycle and output the self energy etc. into a HDF5
file (*seedname*.out.h5).

::

   $ dcore input.ini --np 4

Please invoke ``dcore`` **in a single process**, specifying the process number with ``--np`` option.
In the above case, ``dcore`` will lauch four MPI processes internally using the command specified by the parameter ``command`` in the [mpi] block.

The solver is executed in the working directory named **work/imp_shell0_iter1** (in the case with shell number 0 and iteration number 1).
All output generated by the solver are stored in this working directory.

This program should be executed repeatedly until convergence is reached.
You can resume the DMFT iteration using the previous results by specifying ``restart = True`` in the [control] block (default is ``False``).

.. See :doc:`input` for details of ``restart`` option.

The output file, *seedname*.out.h5, is created, updated, or backed up depending on
whether the previous run exists and also on the ``restart`` parameter.
The behavior is summarized below.

.. csv-table::
    :header: *seedname*.out.h5, ``restart``, behavior
    :widths: 5, 5, 20

    not exists, "True, False", "A new file is created"
    exists, False, "The file is backed up with the name *seedname*.out.h5.bak, and a new file is created"
    exists, True, "The iteration is resumed, and the file is updated"


.. _program_dcore_check:

Convergence-check : ``dcore_check``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program is used to check the convergence of the DMFT loop.

..
    by reading parameters defined in ``[model]`` and ``[tool]`` blocks.

::

    $ dcore_check input.ini [--prefix PREFIX] [--ext EXT]

Here ``PREFIX`` is the prefix for all output files,
and ``EXT`` is the file extension of output figures (png, pdf, eps, jpg, etc).
The default values are ``PREFIX=check/`` and ``EXT=png``.
All results are stored in **check** directory without specified.

..
    ``dcore_check`` shows the history of the calculation of the chemical potential and the average of the self energy for imaginary frequencies,

Three kinds of figures will be included:

- **iter_mu.png**

  The chemical potential as a function of iteration number.

  .. image:: iter_mu.png
     :width: 500
     :align: center

- **iter_sigma-ish0.png**

  The renormalization factor as a function of iteration number.

  .. image:: iter_sigma-ish0.png
     :width: 500
     :align: center

- **iter_occup-ish0.png**

  The spin- and orbital-dependent occupation numbers as a function of the iteration number.

  .. todo::
      figure

- **iter_spin-ish0.png**

  The spin moments as a function of the iteration number.

  .. todo::
      figure

- **sigma_ave.png**

  The averaged self-energy at the last seven iterations.

  .. image:: sigma_ave.png
     :width: 500
     :align: center

  Here, the average is taken as follows:

  .. math::

     \Sigma_{\rm Ave} (i \omega_n) =
     \left[\sum_i^{\rm shell} \sum_{\alpha \beta}^{N_{\rm orb}^i} \Sigma_{\alpha \beta}(i\omega)\right]
     /\left[\sum_i^{\rm shell} N_{\rm orb}^{i}\right],

  The maximum frequency of this plot is specified with the parameter ``omega_check``
  in the ``[tool]`` block.

..    Here, the average is taken over the shell index *i* and the orbital indices *a*, *b*.

.. _program_dcore_post:

Post-processing : ``dcore_post``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This program computes the total DOS (*seedname*\_dos.dat) and momenum-resolved spectral function (*seedname*\_akw.dat) reading the DMFT results in *seedname*.out.h5.

..
    This program reads the parameters defined in the ``[model]``, ``[system]``, ``[impurity-solver]`` and ``[tool]`` blocks.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ dcore_post input.ini --np 4

Here, please specify the number of MPI processes.
The computed spectral function can be drawn by

.. code-block:: bash

   $ gnuplot [seedname]_akw.gp

Using this gnuplot script, you can also see the original (DFT) band structure as follows if either
*seedname*\_band.dat (Wannier90 output) or dir-wan/dat.iband (RESPACK output) exists.

.. image:: ../tutorial/srvo3/akw_srvo3.png
   :width: 500
   :align: center

"+" indicates the original band structure.
The original band structure is shifted by the chemical potential specified by ``mu`` in ``[system]`` block.

Online help
~~~~~~~~~~~

For all programs, online help is available by ``-h`` option.
For example, the help of the main program ``dcore`` looks like

::

    $ dcore -h
    usage: $ dcore input.ini --np 4

    .

    positional arguments:
      path_input_file  input file name.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help       show this help message and exit
      --np NP          Number of MPI processes

Additionally, the complete list of the input parameters are shown.
It would help readers to make use of the latest features in the **develop** branch that are not documented in this manual.
